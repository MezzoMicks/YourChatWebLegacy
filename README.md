YourChatWebLegacy
=================

YourChatWebLegacy, the original YourChat Project which is now being rebuild completely as a full fledged modular Maven-Project

It's kind of a 'learning-by-doing' project, I started to get around with web-technologies.

Deployable as a war-archive.

Needs JTA-Datasource named "PSQLThemis" (well you can alter the name of course)

It's currently not intended for use in production-environments, there might be thousands of security-holes.
